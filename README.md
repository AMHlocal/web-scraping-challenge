# web-scraping-challenge

Note: 
To run this code you are going to need to have the latest version of chromedriver installed.
Have a copy of chromedriver live in the this repo that way you won't have to change the "scrape_mars.py" file. Otherwise update the location that it lives in in the "scrape_mars.py" file.

Next run the app.py file in your terminal. Click the "Scrape New Data" button and the script will populate the fields. This will take about a minute to complete, depending on your local connection.
